## What is HashSet?

### A HashSet is a data structure that provides a way to store a collection of unique elements in an unordered manner. It is typically implemented using a hash table, which allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

## Use Case of HashSets
- <b>Removing Duplicates</b>: HashSets are commonly used when you need to ensure a collection contains only unique elements.
- <b>Membership Testing</b>: Efficiently check whether an element exists in a collection.
- <b>Intersection and Union Operations</b>: HashSets are used to perform operations like union, intersection, and difference on collections.

## Advantages
- Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- Prevents duplicate values automatically.

## Disadvantages:
- Unordered storage (no guarantee of element order).
- Requires a good hash function to minimize collisions.
- Uses additional memory due to the hash table overhead.
