# Key Points to implement Recurrence:

1.  Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2.  Do all possible stuff to the index according to the problem statement
3.  Sum of all stuffs -> count all ways

# For Eg:
    
1.  Find the Minimum of something -> Min( of all stuffs)
2.  Find the Maximum of something -> Max(of all stuffs)
