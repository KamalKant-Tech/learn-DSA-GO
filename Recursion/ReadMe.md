Key Points to implement Recurrence:

1.  Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2.  Do all possible stuff to the index according to the problem statement
3.  Sum of all stuffs -> count all ways

For Eg:
    Find the Minimum of somthing -> Min( of all stuffs)
    Find the Maximum of something -> Max(of all stuffs)
