# Dynamic Programming

- Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

## When To Implement?

    - If a problem can be solved through the recursion so there is possiblity solves the same problem with DP.
    - In other words if there is recurrence in the given problem solution so that particular problem can solved through DP.

## Dynamic Programming Tricks

### Memoization

- Top Down Dynamic Programming
- In Memoization we tend to store the value of subproblem in some map/table.
- The table or map depending on how many parameter are there in function call.

### Tabulation

- Bottom Up Dynamic Programing

### Overlapping Subprobles

- Whenever we end up solving same problem again and again we call it overlapping subproblems.

### How to know/Understand if a given problem is DP or not?

- Count the total number of ways
- Min or Max Problems

- Try all possible ways
    - Count 
    - Best way

### Shortcut Tricks to apply DP any solution

- Try to represent the solution in terms of index.
- Do all possible stuff/operation to that index according to the problem statement.
- Sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
- Minimum of stuffs -> find Min

### Shortcut Tricks to apply 2 DP any solution
-  Count Paths
- Count Paths with Obstacles 
- Min Path Sum
- Max Path Sum
- Triangle Problem
